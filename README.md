BASIC CALCULATOR ASSIGNMENT - PYTHON VERSION

DESCRIPTION This project is a Basic Calculator program written in Python. It runs in the command line and allows users to perform standard arithmetic operations. The program includes error handling for invalid inputs and division by zero, and it features a loop that allows the user to perform multiple calculations without restarting the program.

FEATURES

Operations: Supports Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), and Division (/).

Error Handling: Catches invalid text inputs (non-numbers) and prevents crashes when dividing by zero.

Loop Functionality: Users are asked if they want to continue after every calculation.
